# Singleton Implementation for `JitContext` in a Single-Threaded Compiler

## Overview

In a single-threaded environment where `JitContext` is created only once, using a singleton pattern simplifies code by eliminating the need to pass the `JitContext` object around functions. This document describes the implementation of a singleton `JitContext` and includes example usage.

## Implementation

### `JitContext` Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class JitContext {
public:
    // Static method to get the singleton instance
    static JitContext& getInstance() {
        static JitContext instance;
        return instance;
    }

    // Delete copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent copies
    JitContext(const JitContext&) = delete;
    JitContext& operator=(const JitContext&) = delete;

    // Example method
    void someJitFunction() {
        // Implementation of a method
        std::cout << "Executing some JIT function..." << std::endl;
    }

private:
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    JitContext() {
        // Initialization code
        std::cout << "JitContext initialized." << std::endl;
    }

    // Private destructor
    ~JitContext() {
        // Cleanup code
        std::cout << "JitContext destroyed." << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Static Method `getInstance()`**:
    - Provides global access to the singleton instance of `JitContext`.
    - The `static JitContext instance` is initialized the first time it is accessed and destroyed automatically at the program's end.

2. **Deleted Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**:
    - Prevents creating additional instances by copying or assignment, ensuring there is only one instance of `JitContext`.

3. **Private Constructor and Destructor**:
    - The constructor and destructor are private, so `JitContext` cannot be instantiated or destroyed directly outside the class.

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Function demonstrating usage of JitContext singleton
void useJitContext() {
    JitContext& jitContext = JitContext::getInstance();
    jitContext.someJitFunction();
}

int main() {
    useJitContext();
    useJitContext(); // Notice that this won't reinitialize JitContext
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **useJitContext Function**:
    - Demonstrates accessing and using the singleton instance of `JitContext`.
    - Calls `someJitFunction` on the singleton instance.

- **main Function**:
    - Shows that calling `useJitContext` multiple times does not reinitialize the singleton instance of `JitContext`.

## Benefits in a Single-Threaded Compiler

- **Simplified Code**:
    - No need to pass `JitContext` around functions, reducing boilerplate, and improving readability.

- **Controlled Initialization and Cleanup**:
    - Ensures that `JitContext` is initialized once and cleaned up automatically when the program ends.

- **Global Access**:
    - Easily access `JitContext` from any function without additional parameters.

## Conclusion

Given the requirements of a single-threaded compiler, using a singleton pattern for `JitContext` is a valid decision. The provided implementation guarantees proper management of the singleton instance and avoids common pitfalls such as accidental copying. This pattern ensures that `JitContext` is initialized only once and provides a consistent interface for accessing it throughout your codebase.
