# jitBrainsForth Windows

Forth Jit written largely by the JetBrains AI.
I am going to say 'in cooperation with from now on' since no AI I have used
so far, can actually code, but the JetBrains AI in particular can help a lot.

This is the Windows Intel64 version.
The stack convention requires shadow space on the stack, for every call.

Compiler used is MinGW and you need CMAKE
Current Status Compiles and Runs, under development.

The project does not accept pull requests.

There is also a MacOS intel version of this program.

The MacOS macOS? version has leaped ahead, it will be ported back to Windows again later.
