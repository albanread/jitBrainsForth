# jitBrainsForth Windows

Forth Jit written largely by the JetBrains AI.
I am going to say 'in cooperation with from now on' since no AI I have used
so far, can actually code, but the JetBrains AI in particular can help a lot.

This is the Windows Intel64 version.

The windows stack convention requires shadow space on the stack, for every call.

The compiler I used was MinGW and you need CMAKE
Current Status, it Compiles and Runs, under development.

The project does not accept pull requests.

There is also a newer MacOS intel version of this program.

The MacOS macOS? version has leaped quite far ahead, it will be ported back to Windows again later.
